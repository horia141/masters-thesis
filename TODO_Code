  Task: Add tests in "tc" structure functions for empty values. In particular,
    "tc.scalar", "tc.vector", "tc.matrix" and "tc.tensor" should return false on
    empty objects.

  Task: Make all dependent properties be immutable. Since our objects contain
    only immutable fields, it makes no sense to have dependent properties. We
    can compute them only once, at construction time, and be done with
    that. This should reduce some of the clutter in "samples_set" and "gray_images_set".
  Resolved: Changed the properties in "samples_set" and "gray_images_set" to
    be immutable and computed in the constructor.

  Task: In all "test" functions, make the destruction of objects between tests
    in the order of object creation. Alternatively, use "clear all".
  Resolved: Added a clear all after each test. Also, I've renamed objects so
    they are no longer unique at the function level. For example, most sample
    sets are now called "s"  instead of "s1", "s2" etc. Derived versions of
    such sets are, of course, still called "s_p", "s_f11" etc.

  Task: Make use of the "Causes" field in MATLAB exception handling in the
    code so far. This seems like an implementation of the "hierarchical"
    exception handling I've been thinking about.
