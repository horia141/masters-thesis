  Task: Move all datasets used  in test in "$PROJECT_ROOT/data/test" so
    they'll be accessible no matter what.

  Task: In test functions add "printf" statements for subtests as well as full
    tests.
  Resolved: Added "printf" statements appropriate to each subtest.

  Task: Make code that tests transforms use an approximate test for equality
    of samples. Due to numeric precision errors we might have problems in our
    tests. It's not something we want.
  Resolved: Added the function "utils.approx" and used it in all places where
    transform results comparisons were made.

  Task: Add tests in "tc" structure functions for empty values. In particular,
    "tc.scalar", "tc.vector", "tc.matrix" and "tc.tensor" should return false on
    empty objects.
  Resolved: I've redefined the "type-tree" for this project and rewritten
    tests so they are simpler and more robust. Also, the structural functions
    have been modified as required by this task.

  Task: Make all dependent properties be immutable. Since our objects contain
    only immutable fields, it makes no sense to have dependent properties. We
    can compute them only once, at construction time, and be done with
    that. This should reduce some of the clutter in "samples_set" and "gray_images_set".
  Resolved: Changed the properties in "samples_set" and "gray_images_set" to
    be immutable and computed in the constructor.

+ [2] B:05.03.2012 E:05.03.2012
  Task: In all "test" functions, make the destruction of objects between tests
    in the order of object creation. Alternatively, use "clear all".
  Resolved: Added a clear all after each test. Also, I've renamed objects so
    they are no longer unique at the function level. For example, most sample
    sets are now called "s"  instead of "s1", "s2" etc. Derived versions of
    such sets are, of course, still called "s_p", "s_f11" etc.

  Task: Make use of the "Causes" field in MATLAB exception handling in the
    code so far. This seems like an implementation of the "hierarchical"
    exception handling I've been thinking about.
