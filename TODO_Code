  Task: In all "test" functions, make the destruction of objects between tests
    in the order of object creation. Alternatively, use "clear all".
  Resolved: Added a clear all after each test. Also, I've renamed objects so
    they are no longer unique at the function level. For example, most sample
    sets are now called "s"  instead of "s1", "s2" etc. Derived versions of
    such sets are, of course, still called "s_p", "s_f11" etc.

  Task: Make use of the "Causes" field in MATLAB exception handling in the
    code so far. This seems like an implementation of the "hierarchical"
    exception handling I've been thinking about.
